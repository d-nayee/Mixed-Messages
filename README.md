# mixed-messages

A Codecademy project to build a random message generator using Javascript.

The random message will be in this format:

"Dear Diary,

Yesterday, my _adjective_ _noun_ came to my _noun_.
I appreciated it _adverb_.

Today my _noun_ told me to _verb_ ten times. I don't know why?

Tomorrow, I plan to _adverb_ _verb_ with my _noun_ in the morning. It's on my list of things to do."

The words in _bold_ are the variables which will change each time.

Would appreciate any feedback and improvements.

Feel feel to add on to this to make improvements.
