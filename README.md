# mixed-messages

A Codecademy project to build a random message generator using Javascript.

The random message will be in this format:

"Dear Diary,

Yesterday, my **adjective** **noun** came to my **noun**.
I appreciated it **adverb**.

Today my **noun** told me to **verb** ten times. I don't know why?

Tomorrow, I plan to **adverb** **verb** with my **noun** in the morning. It's on my list of things to do."

The words in **bold** are the variables which will change each time.

Would appreciate any feedback and improvements.

Feel free to add on to this to make improvements.
